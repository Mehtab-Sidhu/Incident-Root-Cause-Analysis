# Incident Root Cause Analysis

A project aimed at identifying the root causes of incidents occurring in data centers using data-driven analysis. Using data about the CPU load, memory load, network delays, and three types of errors, a deep learning model is built to predict the root cause for error.

## Dataset

**File**: `root_cause_analysis.csv`

The dataset contains structured incident data. The dataset has one record for each incident, indicating if any load issues or errors were observed during that time.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mehtab-Sidhu/incident-root-cause-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd incident-root-cause-analysis
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook (`Incident_Root_Cause_Analysis.ipynb`) for step-by-step analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Incident_Root_Cause_Analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Results

The deep learning model helps in predicting the root cause of the incident, using data about the CPU load, memory load, network delays, and errors.
